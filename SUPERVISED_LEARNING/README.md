## 🅰 <u>*SUPERVISED LEARNING*</u>

> Model learns from labeled data (data with input-output pairs).

### 🎯 Goal:
To predict outcomes for new, unseen data based on past labeled examples.

### 📘 Definition:
In supervised learning, the algorithm is trained using a dataset that contains input features (X) and corresponding output labels (Y).
It learns the mapping function f: X → Y.

### 🧩 Examples:
1. Predicting house prices 🏠
2. Email spam detection 📧
3. Disease diagnosis from medical images 🩺
4. Stock price prediction 📊
5. Weather forecasting 🌦
6. Credit card fraud detection 💳
7. Sentiment analysis on reviews 💬
8. Handwritten digit recognition ✍
9. Predicting student grades 🎓
